# HOUSE MOVING WEB APP 
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description: House moving can't be easier than ever without house moving services. The price, time, and service quality are the most essential things. As a house moving service, working only with the phone, and email to contact your next potential customer can't be realistic. So, what about the customer to give a chance to contact us with a good amount of information. And, we can do something with that information. Is that sound pretty good? Let's see how it's go.

## How It's Work?

#### The most important part of building a house moving website is to give a very good amount of information about the service to our customers. But, some of the information can't be delivered without knowing the need of the customers. But, there is a way to overcome that, we can give a form for the user to put some information, and verify that user information, and then the user can send a quote to us. By doing that, the company gets a good amount of user needs and is then able to deliver the desired information back to the user with their submitted contact information. This is send quote.

* __Home Page__
    #### On The home page of the website, the user can find a great amount of information about our service. On that home page, users can fill out the form to find the estimate, but it's will take the user to fill in more information about their needs.

* __Personal Information and Needs__
    #### User can fill out their personal information like the username, email, where they want to move from, where they want to move to, estimated move date, and message.

* __Verification Page__
    #### Now, the last step is to verify whether the user's phone number is valid or not. If valid, we can send some otp to that phone number. But, I don't use communication API. So, the verify code is just static. But, it checks the correctness of the phone number for all countries.

* __FAQ__
    #### Some of the questions are not universal. They are only for certain things. That is where FQA comes in place.

* __About Us__
    #### Background check is quite popular that day.

* __Gallery__
    #### We can connect our customers with some of the works that we have already done, showing visually.

* __Contact Us__
    #### Some customers just need a bit more information about the legitimacy of the company.
