# HOUSE MOVING WEB APP 
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description: House moving can't be easier than ever without house moving services. The price, time, and service quality are the most essential things. As a house moving service, working only with the phone, and email to contact your next potential customer can't be realistic. So, what about the customer to give a chance to contact us with a good amount of information. And, we can do something with that information. Is that sound pretty good? Let's see how it's go.

## How It's Work?

#### The most important part of building a house moving website is to give a very good amount of information about the service to our customers. But, some of the information can't be delivered without knowing the need of the customers. But, there is a way to overcome that, we can give a form for the user to put some information, and verify that user information, and then the user can send a quote to us. By doing that, the company gets a good amount of user needs and is then able to deliver the desired information back to the user with their submitted contact information. This is send quote.

* Home Page
    #### On The home page of the website, the user can find a great amount of information about our service.

* FAQ
    #### Some of the questions are not universal. They are only for certain things. That is where FQA comes in place.

* About Us
    #### Background check is quite popular that day.

* Gallery
    #### We can connect our customers with some of the works that we have already done, showing visually.

* Contact Us
    #### Some customers just need a bit more information about the legitimacy of the company.
